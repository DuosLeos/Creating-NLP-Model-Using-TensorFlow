# NLP Model with TensorFlow

This script demonstrates the process of creating a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model using TensorFlow in a Google Colab environment. The model is designed for text classification, specifically for news articles. Here's an overview of the steps:

1. **Install Kaggle Package and Upload Kaggle API Key**: Install the Kaggle package, upload the Kaggle API key, and set up the required directory.

2. **Download and Unzip Dataset**: Download the dataset from Kaggle and unzip it for further processing.

3. **Load and Explore Dataset**: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and explore its structure.

4. **Data Cleaning**: Perform various data cleaning steps, such as removing HTML tags, URLs, and stopwords.

5. **Analyze and Visualize Data**: Conduct tokenization, n-gram analysis, and visualize key insights from the dataset.

6. **Encoding and Splitting Data**: Apply one-hot encoding to categorical variables and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

7. **Tokenization and Sequential Modeling with Embedding and LSTM**: Tokenize the text data and build a sequential model using TensorFlow with Embedding and LSTM layers.

8. **Train the Model**: Train the NLP model on the training set, monitoring accuracy using callbacks.

9. **Evaluate and Visualize Model Performance**: Evaluate the model on the testing set and visualize its accuracy and loss over epochs.

10. **Create a README**: Document the steps and provide a clear overview of the NLP model creation process in a README file.

Feel free to adapt and modify the script according to your specific NLP use case.
